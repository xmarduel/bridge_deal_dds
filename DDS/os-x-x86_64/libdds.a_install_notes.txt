Installation of libdds.a
------------------------

The dynamic libraries are necessary because DDS is compiled with true gcc
to get OpenMP.

The libraries can be dropped in /usr/local/lib, a directory which does not exist 
on Mac OS X but which is on the default library search path. Users may create it via:

sudo mkdir /usr/local
sudo chmod 775 /usr/local
sudo chgrp admin /usr/local
mkidr /usr/local/lib

Note: The Homebrew package manager carries out these steps.

Alternatively, the location of the dynamic libraries can be specified via the 
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, e.g.

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=.

though using the cwd is probably a bad security practice.
